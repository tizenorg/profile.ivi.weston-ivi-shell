ivi-shell addon:

ivi-shell proposes two features
- Common layout library for surface, which allow ivi-shell developer
  to develop own shell, linking Common layout library.
  For the time being, the library refers Genivi ilm interface.

  http://projects.genivi.org/ivi-layer-management/

- Extension protocal; ivi-application to tie wl_surface and a given ID.
  With this ID, shell can identify which wl_surface is drawn by which
  application. In in-vehicle infortainment system, a shell has to update
  a property of a wl_surface. E.g. there may be a use case when vehicle
  starts to move, the wl_surface drawn by Car navigation is expected to
  move top of surfaces.

Weston

Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, and a
useful compositor in its own right.  Weston has various backends that
lets it run on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input as well as
under X11.  Weston ships with a few example clients, from simple
clients that demonstrate certain aspects of the protocol to more
complete clients and a simplistic toolkit.  There is also a quite
capable terminal emulator (weston-terminal) and an toy/example desktop
shell.  Finally, weston also provides integration with the Xorg server
and can pull X clients into the Wayland desktop and act as a X window
manager.

Refer to http://wayland.freedesktop.org/building.html for building
weston and its dependencies.

The test suite can be invoked via `make check`; see
http://wayland.freedesktop.org/testing.html for additional details.
